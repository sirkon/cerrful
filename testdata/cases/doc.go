// Package main provides code samples for cerrful's functional testing.
//
// It was made “main” deliberately — to discourage anyone from importing it,
// which, while not entirely terrible, would still be pointless. It also
// lacks a real main() function so that “go build” leaves it alone.
//
// Its only purpose is to feed the analyzer. Nothing more, nothing less.
